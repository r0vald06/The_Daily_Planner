# Welcome To The Daily Planner!

Hi! This website was created to serve as an online planner that allows the user to customize by clicking a button on the navigation bar.

# Navigation Bar

Below I will give an explanation of the navigation bar. 

## Messages

The messages navigation button is not fully developed yet but it is special feature that I want to implement in the coming weeks. Once the user clicks the message button a modal should pop up allowing the user to customize the greeting message. Allowing the user to get a different inspirational quote everyday, a specific phrase/reminder, and change color or text size.
